abstract: Several bright and massive galaxy candidates at high redshifts have been recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. Such early massive galaxies seem difficult to reconcile with standard Î› cold dark matter model predictions. We discuss under which circumstances such observed massive galaxy candidates can be explained by introducing primordial non-Gaussianity in the initial conditions of cosmological perturbations.
