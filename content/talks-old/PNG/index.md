summary: Modelling the amplitude of the scale dependent bias from local primordial non-Gaussianity.
abstract: Upcoming galaxy surveys in the next 5-10 years will reach CMB-level sensitivity in constraining local type primordial non-Gaussianity using the clustering statistics of galaxies. In this talk, we show the importance of correctly modelling the clustering of tracers for the purpose of extracting the primordial imprint of non-Gaussianity. We propose a method to precisely calibrate the amplitude of the scale-dependent bias from local-type primordial non-Gaussianity using N-body simulations and compare to other commonly used methods. Using the same technique, we show that cross-correlating voids with halos provides up to 50% improvements in the constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity.
