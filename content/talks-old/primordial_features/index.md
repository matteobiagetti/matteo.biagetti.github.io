summary: Constraints on primordial features using BOSS data and forecasts for future surveys.
abstract: One of the main challenges in cosmology is to characterise the physics of inflation. While a single weakly-coupled scalar field rolling down a very flat potential satisfies the basic requirements that observations impose on an inflationary scenario, a great number of phenomena that could take place during inflation are still unconstrained by data. Primordial features are one example of this phenomena and a well-motivated proof of the early universe in their own right. In this talk, we demonstrate that features in primordial spectra, much like the standard BAO themselves, are immune to the most basic nonlinear processes of the late universe and can be tested with the full statistical power of LSS surveys. We perform a full fledged analysis of the BOSS survey data and put constraints on linearly and logarithmically spaced primordial oscillations which are competitive with the ones obtained from CMB observations. Furthermore, we provide an extensive forecast of future surveys, such as EUCLID, DESI and SPHEREx, showing that the future of constraining primordial features is indeed in LSS observations.
