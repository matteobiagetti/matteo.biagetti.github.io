summary: One of the greatest challenges of modern cosmology is to provide a consistent history of the Universe, from its origins until today. As in all fields of physics, a crucial step to make progress is to gather more observational evidence to confirm or disprove proposed theoretical models. I will discuss about how how the observation of large scale structures at late times provides an increasingly promising probe of the physics of the early universe, with a focus on inflationary predictions, such as primordial non-Gaussianity, primordial features and primordial gravitational waves.
