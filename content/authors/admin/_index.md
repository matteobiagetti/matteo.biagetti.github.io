I am a research scientist. After working for several years in theoretical cosmology, I've recently moved towards data-oriented research. I'm using Topological Data Analysis techniques to study the geometry of representations of convolutional neural networks and large transformer models applied to a diverse range of datasets, including protein sequences, images, and text. I am also the scientific manager of a project funded by the Italian government called FAIR-by-design, to develop [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) workflows of data and metadata for laboratories of material and life sciences.

I am currently employed as a Data Scientist at the Laboratory of Data Engineering ([LADE](https://en.areasciencepark.it/rdplatform-2023/lade-laboratorio-di-data-engeneering/)) at the Institute of Research and Technological Innovation, AREA Science Park in Trieste, Italy.
